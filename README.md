*umbrella* is a code base which can be used to correct the effects of precipitable water vapour (PWV) on near-infrared photometry. It is based on the method described in [Pedersen et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00156). Please cite this paper if you use *umbrella* in your research. 

To begin, take a look at the [`Tutorial.ipynb`](https://github.com/ppp-one/umbrella/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb) notebook. This will walk you through the basic usage of *umbrella*. If you have any questions, please open an issue on this repository.
