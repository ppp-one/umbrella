*umbrella* is a code base which can be used to correct the effects of precipitable water vapour (PWV) on near-infrared photometry. It is based on the method described in [Pedersen et al. (2022)](). Please cite this paper if you use *umbrella* in your research. 

To begin, take a look at the `Tutorial.ipynb` notebook. This will walk you through the basic usage of *umbrella*. If you have any questions, please open an issue on this repository.
